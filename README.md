# JSDrumkit
This Project is part of the 30 days of Javascript Challenge I'm doing by Wes Bos. 

The project uses keyboard input to play sounds of a drum kit. each sound is linked to key inputs. 


I added some of my own sounds using  free wav files I downloaded to make it my own and then after reading on design trends I decided to 
give it a neo-morpism style and I am currently working on making it look better. 


This project thought me how to use audio and data-keys in Javascript and also event listeners and Query selectors. 


Sorry if this ReadME is bad but I will improve on it later as I learn more.
